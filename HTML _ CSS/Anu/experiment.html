       <p style="color:aqua;font-size: 15px;font-style: italic"> mazon.com, Inc., doing business as Amazon (/ˈæməˌzɒn/), is a multinational technology company focusing in e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence in Seattle, Washington. It is one of the Big Four <br>or "Four Horsemen" of technology along with Google, Apple and Facebook due to its market capitalization, disruptive innovation, brand equity and hyper-competitive application process.[6][7]

        Amazon is the most valuable public company in the world ahead of Apple and Alphabet.[8] It is the largest e-commerce marketplace and cloud computing platform in the world as measured by revenue and market capitalization.[9]</br> Amazon.com was founded by Jeff Bezos on July 5, 1994, and started as an online bookstore but later diversified to sell video downloads/streaming, MP3 downloads/streaming, audiobook downloads/streaming, software,<br> video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. The company also owns a publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, a film and television studio, Amazon Studios, produces consumer electronics lines including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TV, and Echo devices, and is the world's largest provider of cloud infrastructure services (IaaS and PaaS) through its AWS subsidiary.[10] Amazon has separate retail websites for some countries and also offers international shipping of some of its products to certain other countries.[11] 100 million people subscribe to Amazon Prime.[12][13]</p>
        
        Amazon is the largest Internet company by revenue in the world[14] and the second largest employer in the United States.[15] In 2015, Amazon surpassed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United States by market capitalization.[16] In 2017, Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion, which vastly increased Amazon's presence as a brick-and-mortar retailer.[17] The acquisition was interpreted by some as a direct attempt</br> to challenge Walmart's traditional retail stores.[18]
